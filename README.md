# Parsing With Clojure Spec

Code for meetup presentation on how to parse the [2020 Advent of Code Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4) Challenge.

The challenge is parsing passport data in key value pairs like `ecl:gry` (eye color gray) and validating that the
value is correct for a given key.

## Repl Driven

The presentation will go through how to get immediate feedback for building up your Clojure Spec parser. How to zoom in
on the part of the parser is failing and slowly accrete functionality will be demonstrated.

## Limitations and Edge Cases

The sharp corners and limitations of Clojure Spec parsing will be gone over.
